## Instructions
Please run the [main] class first to get a feeling about what this game should interact at the basic level.

Then, start reading the code in the following groups 

[Consumable] - [Reminiscence]

[Stat] - [Player] - [Check]

[Demo] -[main]

## Tasks

1. Please helping checking the docstrings and test cases in case anything is not clear enough/wrong
2. Some code may be a bit redundant and if you'd like to optimize feel free to do so without breaking its function
3. Consider how to actually implement a file reader/loader and how to construct the data into corresponding units
4. If you want to add any other classes, make sure to think about which layer it belongs to and its data structure
5. Think of how to convert the scripted methods in [Demo] into an actual class(Tree may be the only way?)


## Notes

1. I decided to implement these classes first because they feel like the basic units (Entity) to me
2. [Check] may be an Entity class after all and [Location] [Characters] may be included in pre written scripts and not the actual classes
3. I didn't actually implement any User Cases class because I feel like my understanding of its concepts is flawed.

   This week's lecture will be dedicated to explain User Cases so I'd prefer to let the lecture explain the details first.
