## Introduction
Inspired by the classical Zork, we are making a simple program which functions as a texted based single player adventure game
that incorporates some DND dice rolling and checking elements.

The user of this game could input and customize their name and some of their character attributes.
The progression of the game story is handled by game console's execution of pre-written story scripts and
determined by user's choices and the result of various checks against character attributes. 

Passing or failing of checks could lead to changes on character attributes and in turn the different branches or even the ending of the game.
Ideally, there will be several story branches so that based on user's choice and progression, user could experience different story paths and 
this game will have a certain level of replay value.

User could also interact with various potential non-player characters such as teammates or even enemies. 
There are also different items along the way which could be added to the inventory and used to affect character attributes, or even facilitate 
the story progression.

We are also looking forward to adding more utility functions to the game in the process of development,
such as saving and loading of game.
