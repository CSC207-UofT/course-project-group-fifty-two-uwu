# Progress Report

##Summary

So far, we've finished:

* The fundamental CRC models and the program specification
* A meaningful portion of the Entity classes of the game
* Some basic implementation of Use case classes
* The minimum extent of Interface Adapter classes so the skeleton program could compile and run
* A skeleton program to demonstrate some basic gaming functions amd the chosen scenario

##Question

* What's the most practical way for our game program to save and load certain data?
* If we want to add a potential battling system, what other Use Case class could facilitate the process?
