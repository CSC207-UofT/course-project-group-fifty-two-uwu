# Progress Report

##Summary

So far, we've finished:

* The fundamental CRC models and the program specification
* A meaningful portion of the Entity classes of the game
* Some basic implementation of Use case classes
* The minimum extent of Interface Adapter classes so the skeleton program could compile and run
* A skeleton program to demonstrate some basic gaming functions amd the chosen scenario

We plan to work on:

* James: I will be working on the classes in the use case layer. Specifically, the StatManager and the PlayerManager classes. These classes will govern how the user can manipulate the Player and the Stat classes, which are entities. 

* Edward: I will be working on the classes in the entity layer, specifically the Computerplayer abstract class and its subclasses. The purpose of all these classes combined is to store the stats of non-player characters, as well as lists of the possible actions they can take in response to the playerâ€™s decisions. 

##Question

* What's the most practical way for our game program to save and load certain data?
* If we want to add a potential battling system, what other Use Case class could facilitate the process?
